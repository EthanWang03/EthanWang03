on average P21 preforms worse than P22 in terms of both Shifts and Execution time
P22 preforms on average 4.378 times better than P21 in terms of number of Shifts
P22 preforms on average 1.2775 times better than P21 in terms of Execution time

P22 actually preforms worse than P21 in one test case which was the z test case
with the same amount of Shifts however P22 was slower than P21 by 0.006000s

P22 preforms much better than P21 in longer words as the the ratio for Execution time 
and Shifts are the greatest with longer words such as Supplementary, Selection and maintain

this is because it skips some chars in the string by using the bad match table making
P22 horspool algorithm fast than P21 brute force
